Hello, I'm Vincent! A Highly organized and meticulous person with experience in corporate office settings. 
I would describe myself as independent, self-motivated team player as well as observant with great attention to details.

After graduating from App Academy, I've acquired a diverse set of technical skills over the past year. From developing a strong proficiency in JavaScript and Python to gaining experience with frameworks like Sequelize, React, and Redux, I'm eager to start the next chapter of my career. As a recent graduate, I'm actively seeking junior software development positions where I can apply and further enhance my skills in a professional setting.
